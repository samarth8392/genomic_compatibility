**Mathur, S., & Gibbs, H. L. (2025).** Genomic evaluation of assisted gene flow options in an endangered rattlesnake. *Molecular Ecology*. [https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.70014](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.70014)


## Research Overview

This study introduces a novel genomic approach to evaluate genetic compatibility for assisted gene flow by analyzing:
- **Deleterious variants**: Mutations potentially harmful to fitness
- **Adaptive variants**: Genetic variants likely under positive selection
- **Local adaptation**: Population-specific beneficial alleles
- **Genetic load**: Burden of harmful mutations

### Key Research Questions
1. What is the genetic impact of introducing individuals from donor populations to recipient populations?
2. How many novel deleterious and adaptive variants would be introduced?
3. What are the effects on masking/unmasking existing deleterious mutations?
4. What is the potential for outbreeding depression through disruption of local adaptation?

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements
- **GATK** (≥4.0): Variant calling and processing
- **BWA**: Read alignment
- **Trimmomatic**: Adapter removal and quality trimming
- **SnpEff**: Functional annotation
- **PROVEAN**: Pathogenicity prediction
- **Samtools**: BAM file manipulation
- **Bcftools**: VCF file processing
- **R** (≥4.0): Statistical analysis and visualization
- **Quarto**: Reproducible document generation

### R Packages
```r
# Required R packages (install before running Quarto notebook)
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "readr", 
                   "genomics", "vcfR", "adegenet", "hierfstat"))
```


## Interpretation Guide

### Compatibility Metrics

1. **Novel Deleterious Variants**: Number of new harmful mutations introduced to recipient population
2. **Novel Adaptive Variants**: Number of potentially beneficial mutations introduced
3. **Masking Effects**: Number of existing deleterious mutations that become masked (heterozygous)
4. **Unmasking Effects**: Number of existing deleterious mutations that become unmasked (homozygous)

### Decision Framework

**Favorable for assisted gene flow**:
- High introduction of adaptive variants
- Low introduction of deleterious variants
- Positive masking effects
- Minimal disruption of local adaptation

**Unfavorable for assisted gene flow**:
- High genetic load introduction
- Loss of local adaptation
- Excessive outbreeding depression risk
