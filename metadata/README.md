# Genomic Compatibility Repository File Descriptions

## Metadata Directory

- **Data1.csv** - Primary dataset containing sample metadata and associated information for the Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake genomic analysis.

- **final152.sampleList.csv** - Complete list of 152 samples used in the genomic compatibility study with their identifiers and population assignments.

- **Scate_HiC.genes.txt** - Reference genome gene annotations for the Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake (*Sistrurus catenatus*) derived from Hi-C assisted assembly.

- **upp10_geneCoord.bed.txt** - BED format file containing genomic coordinates of genes in the upper 10% of the DOS (Departure from Optimal Selection) distribution, representing putatively adaptive genes.

- **upper10_geneInfo.csv** - Detailed information about adaptive genes including functional annotations and selection statistics.

### SNP_pos Subdirectory

- **final152.Syn.pos.txt** - Genomic positions of synonymous mutations that do not alter amino acid sequences.

- **final152.deleterious.pos.txt** - Positions of deleterious mutations combining loss-of-function variants and PROVEAN-predicted damaging mutations.

- **final152.missense.pos.txt** - Locations of missense mutations that result in amino acid changes.

- **final152.nonSyn.pos.txt** - Comprehensive set of non-synonymous mutation positions affecting protein coding sequences.

- **final152.nonsense.pos.txt** - Positions of nonsense mutations that introduce premature stop codons (loss-of-function variants).
